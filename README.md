## 📚 About the Project

This timer was developed to help users manage their productivity using the **Pomodoro Technique** — breaking work into intervals (25 minutes of work, followed by 5-minute breaks). The artifact is powered by Claude AI, making it easy to iterate and fine-tune the design and logic with AI collaboration.

## 📌 Usage

Simply click the **Start Timer** button to begin your focus session. The timer will:
1. Count down 25 minutes of focused work
2. Automatically start a 5-minute break
3. Allow you to pause or restart at any time
